The incident took place on Friday night, police sources said. The woman is out of danger and undergoing treatment in hospital, they said. The accused, Parvinder, has been nabbed, the sources said.  The police said the victim, a medical student, had gone to meet her friend Vishal at Begumpur. Around 11:30pm, Vishal went outside to buy something. Vishal's friend, Parvinder, in the meantime, allegedly tried to rape the victim. ""She resisted and asked him to stop. She then ran out to save herself,"" the police said. On finding no way to prevent the outraging of her modesty, she jumped off the second floor,"" said a police officer. Having suffered injuries, she was bleeding profusely, he said. Upon return Vishal found her lying unconscious; Parvinder told him that the woman, in her 20s, had fallen down by mistake, the police sources said.

The development took place after they admitted to the crime in the custody of Jaripatka police on Friday.  Yashodhara Nagar police had registered a case of accidental death after a semi-decomposed body was found in Bhilgaon on December 27 last year. Later, the body of Prem Thapa was identified. Police had registered a case of murder after it was found that the deceased was strangled.  Meanwhile, Jaripatka police rounded up Shakeel Ahmed and Roshan Behunia for involvement in a riot case at an eatery at Kamgar Nagar on December 28. During interrogation, it came to fore that the duo, along with a couple of others, was behind the murder of Thapa over a dispute.  Thapa, a rape accused, had threatened Ahmed, Behunia and their friends of dire consequences if they did not sponsor liquor. There were heated arguments, threats and counter-threats at Mhada Colony between Ahmed, Behunia and their friends against Thapa.  Following a plan, Ahmed, Behunia and their friends took Thapa to Bhilgaon and strangled him with a scarf before dumping his body at a desolate place.   ","Held for riot, goons admit to murder"

Vowing to put traffic snarls in order in the coming days, the cops called for a joint effort with the traffic department and Guwahati Municipal Corporation to sort public woes.  Addressing the media on Saturday, city SP Apurba Jiban Baruah said police would strengthen the crime branch here to combat criminal activities and to make the city a safer place in the coming years. ""Criminal activities in the city are more or less static in the last few years. The city recorded 61 murder cases in 2011 whereas the figure was 52 in 2010. Our main motto in New Year is to speed up the entire process of detecting and preventing a criminal case. We will also take steps to reduce investigation time and emphasize faster disposal of cases,"" said the SP.  In 2011, there were 973 murder cases, 1312 rapes and 2887 cases of abduction registered in the state till September. City police also highlighted the need to implement a better traffic regulation here. ""We will pay highest attention in improving traffic menace in the city in 2012. We have deiced to take strict action against those who violate traffic laws,"" added Baruah.  The traffic department has realized Rs 2 crore 57 lakh in 2011 in 1, 26, 186 cases of traffic violation. SP (City Traffic) SP Vivekananda Das said, ""The department has chalked out various schemes to make the public aware on 'road safety'. Our prime target will be students and schools. With the help of NGOs and school authorities, the traffic department wants to educate kids on traffic rules for a better future.""  Citing the rise in road accidents in the city due to reckless and drunken driving, traffic police have sent a proposal to the state government to make amendments to the state's MV Act. In 2011, the city recorded 271 deaths and 1103 injuries in a total of 909 accident cases. ""The city is witnessing a major rush of vehicles in the recent past. We want the government to take strict measures in cutting sale of vehicles in the city. We have proposed the state government to make a law so that only a person with a personal parking space would be allowed to purchase a vehicle,"" said the SP.   ","City police eye a safer Guwahati"

""We are surprised over the statement of Andhra director general of police, who mentioned that women are the main cause of rape because of the way they dress,"" a statement issued by the Civil Society Women's Organization (CSWO) here said.  ""What about minors? Three-year-olds and 5-year-olds, what about them?"" the CSWO asked in an apparent reference to rampant rapes of minor girls. Agnes Kharshiing of CSWO said, ""He (Andhra DGP) is covering up for the laziness of cops entrusted with investigation and their connivance with the perpetrators to make money.""  She added, ""Most rape cases do not get convictions due to faulty investigation. There are cases where even medical reports are tampered with to help the accused."" The CSWO said the statement of Andhra DGP only shows that his force is against women and with the perpetrators.  ""We expect the National Commission for Women to take note of this statement, which encourages rape,"" the CSWO added. Andhra Pradesh DGP V Dinesh Reddy on Friday said one of the factors responsible was modern women's preference for fashionable dresses like salwar kameezes.  ""Rapes and murders are not strictly under the control of police. People are turning out to be more fashionable nowadays. Even in villages, they are wearing salwar kameezes. All these lead to provocations and this cannot be under the control of police,"" the DGP said evoking strong condemnation throughout the country.   ","Matrilineal Meghalaya slams Andhra cop remark"

Reddy on Friday was quoted as saying that ""rape is increasing because women have started dressing fashionably"".  ""Once again we are seeing a familiar scenario being repeated. A crime occurs and the victim is blamed. The law enforcing authority absolves itself of all responsibilities. What about the rapist? He was 'provoked' and cannot be blamed! This is the pathetic situation of crime management in India today,"" said SlutWalk team members.  ""We firmly believe that one's actions are of one's own volition and the mere sight of a woman, howsoever dressed, cannot compel a man to rape her. The idea that rape or sexual assault have to do with the way a woman dresses or behaves is problematic,"" said the team in a statement.  ""Sexual assault is not about sex, but power. Women are sexually assaulted whether they wear jeans, a burkha, a sari, a miniskirt or a bathing suit. If sexual assault was caused because of women dressing provocatively, why would women in saris, suits or burkhas are raped or abused? The DGP himself has acknowledged that women are raped even in salwar kameez,"" it pointed out.  ""We know police cannot prevent rape from happening. But we, as a society, can understand why it happens and do something to change our collective mindsets and approach towards sexual assault.

"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Looking-forward-2012-A-better-place/articleshow/11322196.cms","2012-1-1"," Technology and new civic infrastructure will make Delhi a better place to live in this year. Measures such as online challans and speedy trials will improve law and order while bringing down corruption. Services ranging from the airport to hospitals will improve. But expect to pay a little more for the comfort.  Education   Education set for a bold new course this year   The year's first week will probably settle an important question: the entry level for formal schooling. While the minimum age for nursery admissions remains three years, Delhi High Court is likely to decide on January 6 if nursery should be the entry level for school or not. A petition filed by the NGO Social Jurist has pointed out that the current system of schools admitting children aged 3+ to nursery and then directly promoting them to KG is against Ganguly Committee's recommendations that oppose nursery's inclusion in formal schooling.  The year will also see some progress on the plan of Delhi University, JNU, Jamia Millia Islamia and IITD to create a system for students to mix and match their best courses in a hybrid curriculum. Students will be allowed to attend classes in any of these four ins t i t u t i o n s under the name of a meta university. The collaboration follows the government's plan to set up a meta university under National Innovation Council. If all goes as per plan, this university may be launched by July.  In all likelihood, the January 6 general body meet of JNU will bring back student politics to the university. Supreme Court on December 8 vacated the stay on JNUSU elections. The apex court had stayed elections in 2008 for violations of Lyngdoh Committee's recommendations.  It will also be interesting to follow DU's new admission policy that's being worked out by a highpowered committee, which is likely to recommend re-introduction of the pre-registration process and shorten the admission window. The admissions will also be under the scanner due to the fake certificate controversy which mired the 2011-12 process.  While DU, despite rolling out the semester system at the undergraduate level amidst massive opposition from the teaching community, is still fighting a legal battle on the issue, Jamia Millia Islamia is likely to have a smooth run in implementing the system from the 2012-13 academic session. Jamia has been working on the semester system and the curricula for more than two years now.  Heritage   Past won't be a hurdle  This year, people who own property near ASI-protected monuments in the city can expect a response to their applications for carrying out alterations and modifications. With the appellate body, National Monuments Authority, starting work, Delhi Metro can also expect a decision on the fate of its crucial Red Fort line. Delhi's nomination dossier for Wold Heritage City status will also be sent to UNESCO in 2012, marking a significant move in spreading awareness of the city's rich heritage.  Airport   IGI eyes 1,000 flights a day  Having touched the 1,000 aircraft movement once in 2011, IGI Airport is gearing up to having over 1,000 flights on a daily basis in 2012. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is in the planning stage for devising operating procedures under which IGI's three runways can be used simultaneously. The peak hourly capacity of the busiest airport in the country is now about 65 movements, which should go up to 75-80 if the plan is successfully implemented.  By March 31, the airport expects to have handled passenger traffic of 34 million in the fiscal year 2011-12. To improve functioning of the three runways, a new air traffic control tower is also on the cards. Airport officials say the construction of the new tower will begin in the coming year. At a height of 102m, the tower will be taller than Qutub Minar and equivalent to a 32-floor-high building. ""The present ATC tower has limited visibility and one cannot properly see the new runway which is on the other side of terminal 3. The new tower, coming up at a cost of roughly Rs 200 crore, will provide a bird's eye view of the airport,"" said an AAI official.  The new commercial area coming up near the tunnel road between Centaur Hotel and the main runway will finally start showing signs of completion. The first hotel to become operational here will be Ibis Hotel. The 456-room hotel is expected to open by early to mid 2012. More hotels in the area are likely to follow suit in the next few months.  With the construction of the new ATC tower to start in 2012, the black and yellow taxi stand will have to move. The new stand, with space for 1,600 taxis and a cafeteria and restrooms, will come up next to Centaur Hotel and is meant to serve only terminal 3, airport officials said. At one point, 50 taxis can be parked outside the terminal on the arrival concourse.  Modernization of the old cargo complex is also expected to be over in the coming year. A new cargo complex near the old one will also be completed in 2012.  Power   Soon, pick your discom   Revision of power tariff is expected again by mid-2012, which, experts hint, could see another hike going by the loss-making claims of the discoms and statements made by DERC during the revision of 2011.  The coming year may also see the introduction of the system of open access in which consumers would have the freedom to opt for their own power supplier irrespective of where they live.  NDMC   2nd automated parking in Jan  Delhi's first automated multilevel car parking â€” which can accommodate 824 cars â€” was made operational at Sarojini Nagar in December. The nine-storey building will have a shopping complex on the first two floors â€” ground and first â€” and parking space on the rest. NDMC is all set to make the second multilevel parking at Baba Kharak Singh Marg operational in January 2012.  Crime   Modern technology to fight terror  With the threat of terror act iv i t i e s looming large, Delhi Police plans to go high-tech to combat crime in 2012. The department will install more CCTV cameras in the city and roll out a mobile laboratory. It also plans to train more personnel in anti-terror operations.  In 2012, Delhi Police will focus on 'officer-oriented policing', under which a large number of educated subinspectors with exemplary investigative skills would handle important cases. The department plans to surrender about 900 constabulary (constable) posts for some 400 sub-inspectors.  ""We are facing an acute shortage of sub-inspectors. As constables are not authorized to do paperwork like filing reports, we need more investigating officers to cut down on pendency,"" said a senior officer. Cops also hope to curb crimes like chain-snatchings and robberies.  Delhi Police aims to complete the registration of all senior citizens. The department will join hands with various universities and departments to hone communication skills of its officers. It will provide more facilities to personnel, including better offices, improved technical help and more rewards, to encourage its 80,000 officers.  The department will also organize more training exercises for its men in agencies like NSG and FBI in the US. Top officials say the force will work towards improving coordination with police departments of neighbouring states.  Courts   Special courts to speed up justice  The coming year promises a speedy disposal of criminal cases with plans in the offing to revamp the judicial system by creating special courts.  From January, three new CBI courts will become functional at Tis Hazari, Saket and Patiala House to meet the long-standing demand for additional special courts to dispose of the rising number of cases with the investigating agency. These courts will be conducted by special judges.  2012 may also see the establishment of special fast track courts to try rape cases with the Delhi government finally beginning work on creating its firstever special court to fast track cases of assault on women.  The main focus of the judiciary will be on increasing the number of judges in the trial courts for better efficiency. ""Currently, about 500 judges are working and the strength will go up to 700 in a couple of years,"" a source said.  Also, after the division of the capital into nine civil districts, the courts will be divided into nine criminal districts in 2012, streamlining the work. The city will be divided into nine metropolitan areas, with each having its own chief metropolitan magistrate and sessions court for speedy disposal of cases. Currently, Delhi has six district courts and only one chief metropolitan magistrate. Under the new system, each district will have a chief metropolitan magistrate.  The courts have already taken the initiative of establishing the special courts. In 2011, a special court for NIA cases and 2G spectrum was established. Sources say more special courts may be formed if the number of cases with the National Investigating Agency increases.  MCD   New corporations must work out revenue model   The year 2012 will mark the end of the 54-year-old MCD â€” which has 94% of the city under it and caters to 97% of the population â€” after the municipal polls in April. While the Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government has been successful in making the three-way MCD split a reality and defining the contours of the new corporations, what lies ahead is the real challenge of dividing assets and liabilities and working out a viable revenue model.  The 272 seats in 12 zones will be divided among the three corporations with 104 each in South and North Delhi corporations and 64 in East Delhi. At present, property tax is the main source of revenue for MCD but its collection is uneven throughout the 12 zones. Maximum revenue is collected by zones in south and north Delhi. Revenue collection from the east is the weakest. The biggest challenge before the high-level committee led by former bureaucrat K Dharmarajan is to prepare a revenue generating model for all the three corporations, especially for East Delhi.  The trifurcation Bill mentions the Delhi Municipal Fund that will be available for all the three corporations. But decisions on common sources of income like toll tax, property tax and the civic centre will be taken next year. Before splitting MCD, the government needs to have a bailout plan for the corporation, which has a liability of Rs 1,500-1,800 crore.  Though all political parties have welcomed the proposal for 50% reservation for women in the new corporations, it is likely to worry nearly 40% male councillors.  Healthcare   Patient care to improve with more hospitals, doctors  Year 2012 will be time for the government to fulfil long-pending health infrastructure commitments. Four major hospital projects planned in Janakpuri, Tahirpur, Rohini and Dwarka may finally open after years of planning and the government's failure to run them on the public-private partnership (PPP) model. Many private hospitals are also setting up units in Outer Delhi areas, which will improve the health infrastructure.  According to state health minister AK Walia, a fleet of 100 new ambulances is going to be added soon to the Centralized Ambulance and Trauma Services (CATS).  ""We are working on the specifications for the vehicles to be purchased,"" said Walia. He added that radio-diagnostic services and dialysis facilities will be augmented further. ""In view of the acute shortage of dialysis machines in the city and the problem faced by poor patients suffering from renal failure on account of it, we have decided to install standalone dialysis units in all hospitals with private partnership. The interested company will use its own equipment and staff to provide the services, for which everyone except BPL patients will be charged. The government will provide space to them,"" he said.  The health minister added that influenza vaccines will be introduced under the universal immunization programme. Private hospitals overruling court orders with regards to their obligation to treat poor patients free of cost may face government ire.  The state government is going to launch an awareness campaign to make poor people aware of their rights and will set up a special cell to monitor action against hospitals that are not fulfilling their commitment to provide free treatment, despite being allotted land at discounted rates.  Patients visiting AIIMS will no longer have to go through the rigmarole of paying bills separately but can instead pay for all the services â€” registration charges, diagnostic facilities, bed charges, cost for medical implants and surgical consumables â€” together. The premier medical institute and hospital is going to introduce a smart card or cash card soon.  Also, the shortage of doctors at AIIMS may finally end as the institute will recruit more than 100 assistant professors by February.  Traffic   Electronic challaning by March  A number of exciting changes in traffic management await the city this year. While the traffic police have promised that the e-challan project will start by March, components of the Intelligent Traffic Signaling (ITS) system will be gradually introduced.  ""We are in the process of finalizing the tender and the e-challan system should be in place by March,"" said joint commissioner of police (traffic) Satyendra Garg.  Using this system, challans will be issued electronically with hand-held devices, and repeat offenders will pay more. Traffic cops will be armed with hand-held computers attached to a camera and a printer. Photographs of violations will be used as documentary evidence. The devices will be connected to a central server where details will be saved for future reference. The systems will also be GPS-enabled in the final phase. These will have a facility to swipe both credit cards and licences, making the payment of challans easier.  Although no decision has been made about ITS, there are plans to upgrade the current technology with new traffic signals, speed cameras and automated number plate readers (ANPRs). Some stretches like NH-1 and Sardar Patel Marg have already been identified for the system.  The focus will shift to enforcing lane discipline and checking corruption in the traffic police ranks. Although the department claims it has cracked down on corrupt officials, Grameen Sewa and other commercial vehicles are known to flout traffic rules after buying off officials.

Some rape cases and murders of elderly people made headlines in the just gone year. One such rape case was reported in March 2011. Laxmi (name changed) was raped by three fellow villagers after which she got pregnant and gave birth to a girl.  Similar was the story of Sushila who was raped in February. She remained admitted in LLR Hospital for continuous eight months, and yet she is unable to walk. This girl was raped and thrown into a well by her neighbours. Another Lakshmi, a minor girl, was raped in July. The rapist even chopped off her ear and nose.  Nidhi, in just three years of age, witnessed the cruelty of her own uncle who raped her and try to kill her. But she was saved by God's grace. The city witnessed many more such cases in the year 2011. The police officials also admitted that the cases of crime against women were on the rise in 2011.

In a signed statement released by the DGP's office on Saturday, Tejdeep Kaur Menon (additional DGP, training ) and A R Anuradha (IG, law and order), said they were very much present at the DGP's annual press briefing on Friday. ""We are pained and deeply hurt over the twisting of the DGP's statement and blowing it out of proportion and context by a section of the media. What all our DGP stated was to a pointed query about increase in rapes. We strongly condemn such motivated and selfish attempts to sensationalise the statement of our DGP, who is known for championing the cause of women,"" the statement read.  According to the two women officers , Dinesh Reddy had made it clear in his first press conference as DGP that special emphasis should be given for the redressal of the grievances of the aged and women who approach the police. ""He has taken special steps to handle crime against women and also makes special mention during his meetings to review the crimes against women,"" the officers said.  Tejdeep Kaur and Anuradha listed out the steps taken by the DGP. According to them, Dinesh Reddy has given key law and order positions to newly-recruited women DSPs, ensured the posting of women constables and women home guards in every police station, constituted cells in his office to monitor crimes against women and conducted workshops to check human trafficking. The DGP has also taken a serious note of the acid attacks on women and suggested to the Centre that the punishment for the offenders should be enhanced, they said.  In conclusion, they said: ""We have watched him from close quarters as to how he takes care of women visitors who come to him with representations . They are treated with utmost sympathy and empathy and he takes pains to attend to their issues.""  Will 'fair' defence save Dinesh?  However , the DGP's comments on the dress sense of women and the rising incidents of rape were telecast live by the TV news channels and there was no distortion or misrepresentation on the part of the media.  In fact, Union home minister P Chidambaram has already condemned the statement of the DGP and various women organizations have demanded an apology from him. It remains to be seen to what extent the vehement denial by the two women IPS officers that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the DGP and that the media was the culprit would help in bailing out Dinesh Reddy from the controversy he has thrust upon himself. In the meanwhile, some women delegations called on the DGP on Saturday where he explained to them his position. ","DGP's remark twisted: Women cops"
